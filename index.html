                <h2>Think and Grow rich</h2>
                <p>The author researched for over 20 years the lives of hundreds of well-known men who accumulated vast wealth in the course of their lives and attempts to expound on why some people achieve wealth and why some do not. It is down to their way of thinking he says. Learn more by reading the book.</p>

                <h2>The Intelligent Investor</h2>
                <p>According to Warren Buffet, this is the best book on investing. I have yet had the time to delve into enough, but given that Warren buffet says it is a great book it must be. From my skimming through it, I gathered it deals with investing in the stock market. I know this is something risky for newbies. This book will continue to stay on my desk until I get to read it!</p>

                <h2>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</h2>
                <p>This is great book, I enjoyed several years ago. You probably heard about it. The author talks about the mindset one should have regarding managing finances, job life and career in general. He says there 4 types of people in life. Those is quadrants E (employees), S (self-employed), B (business owners) and I (investors). He encourages everyone to aspire to shift away from the “left side” E and S quadrants over to the “right side” that encompasses B and I quadrants. The theory developed there is appealing, but the sad note is that he never says “how to do it” in practice.</p>

                <h2>Education on TAX SECRETS</h2>
                <p>This could be summarized as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The harder you work for money, the more you pay in taxes.</li>
                        <li>The harder your money works for you, the less you pay in taxes.</li>
                        <li>The harder other people’s money works for you, you pay even less in taxes.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>He goes on to say : “You may even pay nothing, zero, zip, nada in taxes. Obviously, this takes the highest
                    levels of financial education. This is a level of education my rich dad inspired me to attain”.</p>

                <h2>Get the life you want</h2>
                <p>This book sounds like “you can get EVERYTHING YOU WANT in life”, is that REALLY true? I am skeptical. Hum. I have not read the whole book yet. But guess what, if the previous assertion was positively true, that would be really great. Imagine being CERTAIN of getting what you want (your dream CAREER, HOUSE, CAR, SPOUSE… You name it!) I will be honest upfront with you. I have NEVER (to this day) met anyone (young OR old, age is irrelevant here) who told me they got EVERYTHING they wanted out of life. So… Anyway reading the book would be a good experience.</p>

                <h2>The CashStrapped Investor</h2>
                <p>I am talking about principles of investments and investor mentality in general. The beauty of investing is that there is room for everyone whether you are deep-pocketed with cash or whether you barely make ends meet. If you have nothing to start with. You could borrow an extra dollar and manage it to get started. The idea behind this book is to demystify the thinking that you must be rich to get started as an investor. In fact it all starts with willingness and adopting the right mindset.
                <br/>This book is still under development.

                <h2>A lease of life</h2>
                <p>Why are you alive? <br/>Why do you exist? <br/>Where do you come from? <br/>You could have been sent on earth a millennia ago or a few centuries in the future, right? So, why must you have come to exist specifically at this contemporary time and epoch?
                I believe there is nothing that happens without a reason… I try answering these philosophical questions in this book. I know it sounds like <em>“thinking too much”</em>, but you should have an understanding of where you come from to better map ahead where you are headed to with life. Your life as you will get to discover is simply a loaned asset that you are meant to fructify during your stay on earth. The life you host will be taken away someday. You are simply a tenant and it doesn’t belong to you. Nonetheless, you can make the most out of it if you adopt the right mindset. Getting to know what matters for you, what your objectives are and the key performance indicators of your life are all essential points to clarify for each individual. <br/>
